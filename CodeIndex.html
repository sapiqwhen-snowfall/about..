    <p>Welcome, if you are muslim, 'Assalamualaikum'</p>
    <p>12, December 2024</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Hello everyone, introducing myself, I am Shafira Mar'atul Muusyarrofah Syifariyadi, you can call me shafira (or for close friends call me as you like). I come from East Kalimantan. For now, I am 14 years old, and 1 month from now I will be 15 years old. </p>
    <p>I am a student who goes to school on the island of Java, and more precisely I am in Yogyakarta. My existence in Yogyakarta makes me feel that “Going from a place you don't like will make you feel more comfortable, but the place you don't like is the beginning of your journey”.  Remember the ups and downs are all over the place.</p>
